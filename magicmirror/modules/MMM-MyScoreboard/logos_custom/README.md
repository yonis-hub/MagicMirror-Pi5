# Instructions for Using 'logos_custom' Folder

This folder can be used to add your own logos for teams to suit your style.  Though if you have a logo you think should be added for everyone, please share it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dathbe/MMM-MyScoreboard/issues).

Files placed in this folder will not be overwritten when you update the mudule.

For the logo to be properly picked up by the module, follow these simple rules:

1) place the logo in a subfolder named for the league the team plays in (e.g., "MLB" or "ENG_PREMIERE_LEAGUE")
2) name the file for the abbreviated team name (e.g., "TEX" or "TOT")
3) you may use either a "png" or an "svg" file extension

For example, adding the file `/logos_custom/MLB/TEX.svg` will display your personal Texas Rangers logo instead of the logo that comes with the module.

SVG files have priority over PNG files of the same name.
